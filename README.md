This BepInEx plugin is designed to add an additional layer of customization to Carol, the protagonist of the game Onirism. 

It adds an always-available menu via Keypad 0 or Mouse3. This menu allows you to select from every object in all of the game's clothing options, and use parts from any of the game's built-in outfits. 

In addition, these parts can be further customized by swapping texture materials from other outfits, or from those found in the game world. World textures can be selected by shooting them. 

The outfit menu also allows you to select standard outfits and their multiplayer variants. 

You can save the clothing combinations you like into Recipe files, which can be saved and shared.

Saved recipes can be used to customize the bots found in multiplayer mode and the campaign. They can also be used to customize Shezara. 

Customization applies during all cutscenes, including cutscenes that don't normally use the player's selected outfit. 

Clothing selection, recipe management, and plugin settings are all available using an in-game UI.
